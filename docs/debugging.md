## Debugging

The process of finding and correcting errors is called debugging. With Visual Studio Code and the AL Language extension you get an integrated debugger to help you inspect your code to verify that your application can run as expected. You start a debugging session by pressing F5.

For more Information see the Offical Documentation for Debugging from Visual Studio Code [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
